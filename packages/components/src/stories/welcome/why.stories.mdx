# What is a Design System?

<bal-doc-lead>
  A design system is a collection of reusable functional elements–components and patterns, guided by clear standards
  that product teams use to create a consistent experience across a range of products. Design Systems act as a single
  source of truth for an entire organization by using a singular design language to guide the development of products.

## Why should everybody use Design Systems?

A Design System is not just a collection of design artifacts – there is a whole philosophy behind. To create a great user experience, product teams should understand not only what they need to build but also why they need to build it. That’s why design vision (in the form of a company or product strategy) and design principles (fundamental ideas about the practice of user interface design) should always be used as a foundation for design systems. Your design vision acts as a North Star for designers, communicating to product teams the purpose of their designs. Design principles guide product teams by helping them reach the ultimate purpose or goal of the product.

Well structured Design Systems provide enough freedom for product teams to experiment and try different creative approaches to solving problems. Product teams should never face major roadblocks from a Design System when implementing new visuals – it should always be easy to update a design in modern and fresh ways.

Design Systems should also be flexible and responsive to any changes in the field of design, such as new visual design trends or the rising importance of different types of emerging technology.

## Advantages

In this section key advantage of the library are listed which are part of the Baloise Design System.

### 📦 Agnostic

Perhaps one of the most appealing benefits of using Web Components is the flexibility to choose the underlying tools and frameworks (including their versions). To facilitate the effort of teams to use one unified standard based on Web Components, every team has complete freedom in choosing the tools they love today and will love tomorrow.

#### Framework Support

The Baloise Design System can be used with any Web-Technology, however we deliver a dedicated library for Angular, Vue and React with proxy components.

> For more integration documentation like react or svelte go to the stencil documentation about [Framework Integration](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).

### 🎨 Fast style changes

Today, every change to the corporate Style-Guide has to be implemented by each development team. This costs a lot of effort and generates unnecessary costs. Let's imagine that a color has to be changed and buttons have to be made flat. With the Baloise Design System only the according [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) variables have to be changed.

```scss
$blue: red;
$radius: 0;
```

The changes will be released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baloise/design-system-components) from where development teams can grab new changes.
Only the library has to be upgraded by every project and style changes are immediately applied.
Style changes will not change the component interface, meaning that the developers don't have to do any additional adjustment.

### ⚡️ Fast Runtime

[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Web_Components) offered a solution by pushing more work to the browser for better performance. Moreover, the components get lazy loaded when they need. To keep the initial package size of your project as small as possible.

#### Browser Support

The Library supports the following browsers. For more details go to [Stencil - Browser Support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support).

### 🛠️ Rich Features

On top of the user interaction and style part, the library also provides a set of utilities.

#### Testing

As a [E-2-E testing](?path=/docs/getting-started-testing--page) tool we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). With the help of our custom and overridden commands we try to simplify writing tests.
The commands hide the complexity of the component and only serve as an interface for simulated user actions like a click.

```typescript
import { byTestId } from '@baloise/design-system-testing'

describe('Button', () => {
  it('should ...', () => {
    const button = byTestId('button-id')
    cy.get(button).contains('Label').click()
  })
})
```
