# Migration from 2.x to 3.x

The following workflow walks through the steps of migrating from version 2.x to 3.x.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

Did you use a sticky footer?

If `no` than you can just upgrade.
However, if `yes` than add the attribute `has-sticky-footer` to you `bal-app` component.

```html
<!-- - old -->
<bal-app></bal-app>

<!-- + new -->
<bal-app has-sticky-footer></bal-app>
...
```
