# Migration from 10.x to 11.x

The following workflow walks you through the migration steps.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

## Improved SASS styles

In the new version 11 we introduced the packages tokens and css. Those are build on SASS not SCSS and
provide a lot of CSS-Variables.

Therefore, update your `global.scss` import to just `global` or `global.sass`.
Moreover, change the import path to the alias `~` instead of using a relative path to the installed package.

```sass
<!-- - old -->
@import '../node_modules/@baloise/design-system-next-components/src/styles/global.scss';


<!-- - new -->
@import '~@baloise/design-system-next-components/src/styles/global';
```

To style your components we recommend to use css variables, however if you want to use sass variables import `global.utilities`:

```
@import '~@baloise/design-system-next-components/src/styles/global.utilities';
```

do not import for example `global.variables` everything should be provided by `global.utilities`.

### Vue / Vite

In order to get the `~` alias working, update the vite.config.ts file and add the resolve config
to the defineConfig function.

```typescript
  resolve: {
    alias: [
      {
        // this is required for the SCSS modules
        find: /^~(.*)$/,
        replacement: "$1",
      },
    ],
  },
```

## New breakpoint high-definition

The high-definition breakpoint gets introduced in the new version. It starts at 1280px and is added between desktop and widescreen.

The only breaking change is that the range of the sass mixin desktop-only is changed.
