# Migration from old to next

The following workflow walks through the steps of migrating.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

## Improve initial page load

The browser needs some time to load the web-components, because of that when the page is loaded we see some unfinished layout.
To avoid that set the below style tag into your head of the `index.html`. This will hide the app content until the web-components are ready.

```html
<style>
  .bal-body {
    visibility: hidden;
  }
</style>
```

Next set the class `.bal-body` to your app container. In the most cases it is the body element of your `index.html`.
