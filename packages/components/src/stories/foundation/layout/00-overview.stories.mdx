## Basic Application

This is the layout for a basic web application.

The layout is constructed with a container to give the content a max-width and a standard space to the right and left side
of the screen. Navbar should be used for web applications and the Navigation for Webpages.
The footer component automatically grabs the necessary links from our CMS so that they are always up to date.
