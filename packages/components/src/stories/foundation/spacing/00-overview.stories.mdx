<bal-doc-lead>
  Global spacings help us design experiences that scale with consistency, rhythm, and focus. Our spacing system follows
  the same principles as our <a href="?path=/docs/foundation-grid-overview--page#grid">grid system</a>. It creates a
  visual balance that makes content easier to scan for the user. With the application of consistent spacing the quality
  of the UI can be improved.

## Spacing Sizes

We use 10 spacings across the Design System.

## Spacing Guidelines

### Heading + Content

We use two sizes of spaces after a Heading to its own section 16px or 8px.

import SpacingHeadings from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/spacing/heading-content.svg'

<img loading="lazy" src={SpacingHeadings} />

Sections are divided with 128px, however if the section is connected we use 64px instead.

import Sections from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/spacing/sections.svg'

<img loading="lazy" src={Sections} />

### Cards

To use multiple cards we recommend to use our grid to get the correct spacings. The space between cards is 32px.

import CardLayout from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/spacing/card-layout.svg'

<img loading="lazy" src={CardLayout} />

#### Inner Spacings

Inner spacings of card is less the then the Heading + Content section.

import Card1 from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/spacing/card-1.svg'
import Card2 from '../../../../public/assets/images/foundations/spacing/card-2.svg'

<br />
<div class="columns">
  <div class="column is-6">
    <img loading="lazy" src={Card1} />
    <p>Inner sections space is 8px</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-6">
    <img loading="lazy" src={Card2} />
    <p>Sections have a space of 24px</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Examples

<img loading="lazy" src={ContentPage1} />
