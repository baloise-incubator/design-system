  <b>Icons</b> are pure svg files. To add a new icon just place your svg file into the
  <a href="https://github.com/baloise/design-system/tree/master/packages/icons/svg">folder</a>. Then the build script
  will automatically optimize the svg and provide it to the component. It is important that the svg icons are made with
  fill elements instead of strokes.
