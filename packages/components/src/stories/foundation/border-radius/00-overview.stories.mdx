## Border

Border as used for form controls, links, tabs and steps.
For horizontal or vertical border lines the edges should use the rounded radius.

### Width

All our borders have the width of 2px.

### Colors

These colors are used to box elements prioritized with following different colors.
They also can be used to give specific meanings like selection, success, error, etc.

## Radius

Our radius follows a rule of multiple of 4. Scale creates a visual balance that makes it easier to understand the interface.

The **Normal radius** is used for smaller elements:

- Form controls
- Clickable elements (e.g. Button)
- Shapes

The **Large radius** is used for all elements:

- based on cards (e.g. Notification, Sheet etc.).
- used as overlay (e.g. Modal, Toast, Snackbar etc.).

The **Rounded radius** is only used in special cases (e.g. tags)
