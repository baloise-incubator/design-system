<bal-doc-lead>The Baloise Design System uses a custom font for headings and body texts.</bal-doc-lead>

## Usage

Key values of the font are stored in our Design Tokens.

- [Font Family](?path=/docs/foundation-tokens--page#font)
- [Font Sizes](?path=/docs/foundation-tokens--page#font-sizes)
- [Font Wight](?path=/docs/foundation-tokens--page#font-weight)

The CSS-Framework links the tokens to the HTML elements and provides CSS utility classes to modify text elements.

- [Titles / Headings](?path=/docs/foundation-css-framework--typography-titles)
- [Texts / Paragraphs](?path=/docs/foundation-css-framework--typography-texts)
- [Links](?path=/docs/foundation-css-framework--typography-texts#links)
- [Text Colors](?path=/docs/foundation-css-framework--text-colors)

In the Design System Component Library there are two main components for the font / typography.

- [Heading](?path=/docs/Components-heading--basic)
- [Text](?path=/docs/Components-text--basic)

## Download

Download the following font for print usage. For web development please continue reading.

<bal-doc-app>
  <bal-doc-download
    subject="fonts.zip"
    subtitle="Our typography files"
    link="/assets/download/fonts.zip"
  ></bal-doc-download>
</bal-doc-app>

## Install web font

Fonts are provided as [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baloise/design-system-fonts). With the font files also css and sass files are delivered.

> **TIP**
> The font package is included in the `@baloise/design-system-components` package and also in the proxy libraries.

To install the fonts directly to your project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @baloise/design-system-fonts
```

### Usage

In a next step the fonts have to be provided for the web application. It is recommended to use following tool [copyfiles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copyfiles) to copy the font files into your assets folder.

```bash
npm install copyfiles --save-dev
```

After installing the copyfiles dependency the copy command needs to be defined in our **package.json** file. Therefore a new script called `copy:fonts` has to be added and the second path to your application has to be adapted.

The downloaded fonts have to be placed in a folder in the public area. The path with the sass variable `$font-path` has to be configured or the default `assets/fonts` has to be used.

```scss
$font-path: 'assets/fonts';

@import '@baloise/design-system-components/src/styles/global';
```

> **TIP for Angular apps**
> For angular apps the default path would be `src/assets/fonts` instead of **public/assets/fonts**

> **TIP Relative Path**
> To serve the fonts from a relative path inside a Angular application adjust `$font-path` variable to `'~assets/fonts'`.
>
> ```scss
> $font-path: '~assets/fonts';
>
> @import '@baloise/design-system-components/src/styles/global';
> ```

Then we add the defined script `copy:fonts` in our `postinstall` script. Every time we install dependencies the `copy:fonts` script gets executed at the end.

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "npm run copy:fonts",
  "copy:fonts": "copyfiles --flat node_modules/@baloise/design-system-fonts/lib/* src/assets/fonts"
}
```

> **TIP CI&CD**
> It might be that inside the docker container the `postinstall` does not get executed. Therefore, use `npm run ci --unsafe-perm` to execute postinstall after the install script.

### CDN

Configure the fonts in a css file.

The package `@baloise/design-system-fonts` also delivers a css file with the config for typography. Add the `fonts.css` into the `head` of the webpage.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@baloise/design-system-fonts/lib/fonts.css" />
```

Next [download the font](/design/typography.html#download) to use it with the CDN setup and put them into the path `/assets/fonts` of the webpage.

### Webpack

Import the css directly into your main TypeScript or JavaScript file.

```typescript
import '@baloise/design-system-components/dist/design-system-fonts/lib/fonts.css'
```
