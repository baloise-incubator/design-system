# CI & CD

> We use opensource tooling to make our processes simpler

We use Github as our software development platform, which is the leading platform for open-spource projects in the world.
For new features or fixes we develop them in seperate branches which will result in a pull-request. Github Actions, our CI tool, listens on webhooks and starts building & testing our application in a seperate container. Moreover, our deployment platform Now also listens for fired webhooks and automatically deploys the code of the pull request to a preview environment. All this is shown in the open pull request on Github. So other developers and UX specialists can easly review, comment, approve or decline the new changes.

After a pull request has been approved, it will be merged into master, which is our default branch. github Actions reacts on the merge action and starts its configured workflow. There is a slide diffrence to other builds, which is the release part. The release process is fully automated with sematic release.
Based on the commit messages since the last release, it detects the release type (major, minor or patch).

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                     | Release type               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied`                                                                                                               | Patch Release              |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                                                                                                                                         | ~~Minor~~ Feature Release  |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed. The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.` | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release |

After detecting the new version, it also publishes the library to npm. Afterthat, it releases it on Github with a nice changelog, which is generated based on the commit messages. Finally, it gets deployed to the production environment of now.
