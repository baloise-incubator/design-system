## Getting Started

All our components are located in the `packages/components/src/components`.

Before writing or updating a component, please finish the [dev setup](?path=/docs/development-contributing-dev-setup--page)

To create a new one just run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

> Every component in this project should start with the prefix `bal-`.
