# Architecture

The Baloise Design System is an open source project to build customer centric web applications following the Baloise corporate styling guidelines.

The architecture is based on web standards and best practices. Moreover, we try to keep it as simple as possible for our contributors and consumers.
For those reasons we decided to use Web Components which are supported by all modern browsers. The project fully supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Architecture Library

The project is divided into various packages. The graphic below draws a more detailed picture.

| [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) | Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. |
| [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)                            | A Web Component compiler for building fast, reusable UI components and Progressive Web Apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Architecture Documentation

To document the components and design parts we use [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Stencil.js

> Stencil is a toolchain for building reusable, scalable Design Systems. Generate small, blazing fast, and 100% standards based Web Components that run in every browser.

### Here are some advantages

#### Future Friendly

We don't know what will be the next big framework, but by using Stencil that does not matter. Stencil is not dependent on any framework. As mentioned above it is a compiler to generate standard-based [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), which can be used with any framework.

#### TypeScript Support

TypeScript helps maintaining the code. Additionally, Stencil generates types for the components, which helps during development.

#### Browser Support

For the small minority of browsers that do not support modern browsers, features and APIs, Stencil will automatically polyfill them on-demand.
Out-of-the-box browser support includes all modern browsers starting from Internet Explorer 11 ([Browser Support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support)).

#### Easy to learn

The tiny API and concepts, which are based on web standards, are quite similar to the concepts and APIs of the most known JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue and Angular. So it is really simple to get started. The goal is not to create yet-another-framework, but rather provide tooling for developers to generate future-friendly components using APIs already baked within the browser.

#### Needs no dependencies at runtime

The generated code does not rely on Stencil, but rather generates highly-optimized, framework-free, stand-alone code which runs natively in browsers.

## Storybook

> **Build component driven UIs faster**
> Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.

### Here are some advantages

#### Playground

The developers can create components in an isolated environment and have an interactive showcase/playground.
Change controls/props, have a look at fired events and a lot more is possible with playground.

#### Accessibility

Storybook evaluates the components against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).

#### Documentation

A perfect mix of documentation with markdown and creating stories/variants of components for the playground.

#### Addons

Storybook has a rich list of available addons which can be integrated very easy, like accessibility checks.

### SWOT analysis of Storybook

Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for UI components.
