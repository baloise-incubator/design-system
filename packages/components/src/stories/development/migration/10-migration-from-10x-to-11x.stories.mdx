# Migration from 10.x to 11.x

The following workflow walks you through the migration steps.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

## bal-input pattern

To disable certain key presses we added a new prop called `allowedKeyPress`.
To validate the pattern of the input use the prop `pattern`.

Here is an example for a postal code input.

```html
<!-- old -->
<bal-input pattern="[0-9]"></bal-input>

<!-- new -->
<bal-input pattern="[0-9]{4}" allowed-key-press="[0-9]"></bal-input>
```

## bal-input type to elementType

The prop `type` was renamed to `elementType` to avoid html attribute conflicts.

## bal-text small to size

With the new brand we have various text sizes, therefore the small prop was removed and replace with an enum type size.

## Prop inverted

Property inverted was removed, since there will be no inverted styles for the new brand.

## Improved SASS styles

In the new version 11 we introduced the packages tokens and css. Those are build on SASS not SCSS and
provide a lot of CSS-Variables.

Therefore, update your `global.scss` import to just `global` or `global.sass`.
Moreover, change the import path to the alias `~` instead of using a relative path to the installed package.

```sass
<!-- - old -->
@import '../node_modules/@baloise/design-system-components/src/styles/global.scss';


<!-- - new -->
@import '@baloise/design-system-components/src/styles/global';
```

To style your components we recommend to use css variables, however if you want to use sass variables import `global.utilities`:

```
@import '@baloise/design-system-components/src/styles/global.utilities';
```

do not import for example `global.variables` everything should be provided by `global.utilities`.

### Vue / Vite

In order to get the `~` alias working, update the vite.config.ts file and add the resolve config
to the defineConfig function.

```typescript
  resolve: {
    alias: [
      {
        // this is required for the SCSS modules
        find: /^~(.*)$/,
        replacement: "$1",
      },
    ],
  },
```

## Performance update icons

To reduce the initial page load, the icon fetching was changed. In the new version the icons will not be
automatically fetched.

There are two ways to import the svg icons.

### 1. import svg directly (recommended)

Import the svg into your component and pass it with the prop `svg` of the `bal-icon` component.

```typescript
import { balIconAccount } from '@baloise/design-system-icons'
```

```HTML
<!-- Angular --->
<bal-icon [svg]="balIconAccount"></bal-icon>

<!-- Vue --->
<bal-icon :svg="balIconAccount"></bal-cion
```

### 2. import all svg

Second variant is to import all the svg icons during the initialization. This is not recommended,
because it increases the payload of your app.

#### Angular

```typescript
...
import * as balIcons from '@baloise/design-system-icons'

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    ...
    BalCoreModule.forRoot({
      defaults: {
        region: 'CH',
        language: 'en',
        allowedLanguages: ['de', 'fr', 'it', 'en'],
        icons: balIcons,
      },
    }),
    ...
  ],
  ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Vue

```typescript
...
import * as balIcons from '@baloise/design-system-icons'

createApp(App)
  ...
  .use(
    createBaloiseDesignSystem({
      defaults: {
        region: 'CH',
        language: 'en',
        allowedLanguages: ['de', 'fr', 'it', 'en'],
        icons: balIcons,
      },
    }),
  )
  .mount('#app')
```

## New breakpoint high-definition

The high-definition breakpoint gets introduced in the new version. It starts at 1280px and is added between desktop and widescreen.

The only breaking change is that the range of the sass mixin desktop-only is changed.

## Improve initial page load

The browser needs some time to load the web-components, because of that when the page is loaded we see some unfinished layout.
To avoid that set the below style tag into your head of the `index.html`. This will hide the app content until the web-components are ready.

```html
<style>
  .bal-body {
    visibility: hidden;
  }
</style>
```

Next set the class `.bal-body` to your app container. In the most cases it is the body element of your `index.html`.
