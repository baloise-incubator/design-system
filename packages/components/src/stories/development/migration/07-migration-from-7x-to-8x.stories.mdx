# Migration from 7.x to 8.x

The following workflow walks you through the migration steps.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

## Tabs

The property `rounded` has been replaced with `interface="tabs-sub"`

```html
<!-- - old -->
<bal-tabs interface="tabs" rounded>...</bal-tabs>

<!-- + new -->
<bal-tabs interface="tabs-sub">...</bal-tabs>
...
```
