## Color

Baloise uses colors purposefully to communicate how things function in the interface. This helps us create visual patterns that can make interacting with our products easier and more predictable for customers.

### Using color styles

Color styles can be enabled by adding the ‘Baloise DS for Web: Colors’ library to your Figma files.

## Typography

Using consistent and logical hierarchies ensures that elements in the UI are clear and easily recognizable when scanning the page. Text sizes, styles, and layouts were selected to balance content and UI and to foster familiarity.

### Using text styles

Color styles can be enabled by adding the ‘Baloise DS for Web: Typography’ library to your Figma files.
