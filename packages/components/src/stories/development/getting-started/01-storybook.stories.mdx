## Docs

The `Docs` tab provides more in-depth documentation regarding specific properties or common functionalities.
To access click on the Docs tab on top of the screen. This is also where the component API can be located.

<img src={docsImage} alt="docs" style={{ width: '300px' }} />
<br />
<br />

## Playground

Each component has a `Docs` and `Canvas` tab. The `Canvas` tab is our playground to test and display variants of components.
In the example you will find the button component with it's four variants (Primary, Secondary, Link, Square). Every variant has its own canvas and playground.

<img src={sidebarImage} alt="sidebar" style={{ width: '300px' }} />
<br />
<br />

### Controls

The the playground / canvas allows users to learn more about specific properties available to components.
This allows to simulate the component in different variants and values.
To access properties, navigate via the controls tab at the bottom of the canvas.
Keep in mind: Not all properties are hooked up into the controls tab.
For a comprehensive list of properties available for each component, navigate to the Docs tab.

<img src={controlsImage} alt="controls" style={{ width: '600px' }} />
<br />

### Actions

Within the Playground story, you can also access the Actions tab, which shows the event signature of actions available for the component.

import actionsImage from '../../assets/images/storybook/actions.png'

<img src={actionsImage} alt="actions" style={{ width: '300px' }} />
<br />
<br />

### Accessibility

Each component should meet the [Accessibility Guidelines AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance). To see possible violations the tab Accessibility was added with detailed action items listed.
