  The Baloise Design System was created in order to help teams building high-quality digital experiences for the web,
  providing shared colors, styles and components.

## Prototyping / FIGMA

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are needed to construct the Baloise Design System. Values like colors, typography, spacing and more.
Moreover, tokens are tech-agnostic so they can be used across multiple platforms such as Web or Mobile.

- [Colors](?path=/story/design-colors--page)
- [Typography](?path=/story/design-typography--page)
- [Spacing](?path=/story/design-spacing--page)
- [Breakpoints](?path=/story/design-breakpoints--page)

## CSS Framework

The CSS framework is build on top of the design tokens and of the Bulma CSS framework. Just some parts are
included from Bulma. We try to keep the CSS file as small as possible.

Get started with a wide range of shorthand utility classes to modify an elementâ€™s appearance in your own application.

- [Grid](?path=/story/design-grid--page)
- [Layout](?path=/story/design-page-layout--page)
- [Form](?path=/story/design-form--page)
- [CSS Helpers](?path=/story/design-css-helpers--page)
- [Flexbox Helpers](?path=/story/design-flexbox-helpers--page)

### Installation

The CSS Framework is provided as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baloise/design-system-next-fonts).

> **TIP**
> The CSS Framework package is included in the `@baloise/design-system-next-components` package and also in the proxy libraries.

To install the CSS Framework directly to your project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @baloise/design-system-next-css
```

After the installation include the provided CSS or Sass file into your project.

Here is a basic HTML5 example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Framework - Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@baloise/design-system-next-css/css/baloise-design-system.css" />
  </head>
  <body class="bal-app has-sticky-footer has-background-grey-0">
    <main class="container py-4">
      <section class="has-background-white has-radius has-shadow p-4 mb-4">
