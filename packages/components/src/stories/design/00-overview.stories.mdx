  The Baloise Design System was created in order to help teams building high-quality digital experiences for the web,
  providing shared colors, styles and components.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are needed to construct the Baloise Design System. Values like colors, typography, spacing and more.
Moreover, tokens are tech-agnostic so they can be used across multiple platforms such as Web or Mobile.

    Go the Tokens
  </a>
</bal-doc-app>

<br />
<br />

## CSS Framework

The CSS framework is build on top of the design tokens and of the Bulma CSS framework. Just some parts are
included from Bulma. We try to keep the CSS file as small as possible.

Get started with a wide range of shorthand utility classes to modify an elementâ€™s appearance in your own application.
