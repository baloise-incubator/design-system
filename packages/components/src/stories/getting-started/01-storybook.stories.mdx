# How to use Storybook

For our documentation we use the tool [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Docs

The `Docs` tab as a more in-depth documentation regarding specific props or common functionality.
To access these, click the Docs tab at the top of the screen. This is also where the component API can be located.

import docsImage from '../assets/images/storybook/docs.png'

<img src={docsImage} alt="docs" style={{ width: '300px' }} />
<br />
<br />

## Playground

Each component has a `Docs` tab and a `Canvas` tab. The `Canvas` tab is our playground to test and play around with the variants of our components.
In our example we have a look at the button component and see 4 variants Primary, Secondary, Link and Square. Each of them has it own canvas / playground.

import sidebarImage from '../assets/images/storybook/sidebar.png'

<img src={sidebarImage} alt="sidebar" style={{ width: '300px' }} />
<br />
<br />

### Controls

The the playground / canvas allows users to dig in to specific props that are available to that component.
This allows you to view the component in different variants and with different data values.
To access these props, navigate via the controls tab at the bottom of the canvas.
Keep in mind, not all props are hooked up into the controls tab.
For a comprehensive list of props available for each component, refer to the Docs tab.

import controlsImage from '../assets/images/storybook/controls.png'

<img src={controlsImage} alt="controls" style={{ width: '600px' }} />
<br />

### Actions

Within the Playground story, you can also access the Actions tab, which shows the event signature of actions taken on that component.

import actionsImage from '../assets/images/storybook/actions.png'

<img src={actionsImage} alt="actions" style={{ width: '300px' }} />
<br />
<br />

### Accessibility

Each component should meet the [Accessibility Guidelines AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance), therefore we have the tab Accessibility.
This allows you to see the violations of your component and of course to fix it.

import accessibilityImage from '../assets/images/storybook/accessibility.png'

<img src={accessibilityImage} alt="accessibility" style={{ width: '600px' }} />
<br />
